  <h1>Migas con huevo</h1>  
  <p>I don't know if there's confusion as in some forums I've seen chilaquiles being mistaken with migas con huevo. I eat this every saturday and at least in my circles, 
    migas con huevo is a mexican dish which is basically scrambled eggs with corn tortillas sliced or torn apart and fried to taste, you can add any kind of toppings to it, going
  from sausages, corn or chorizo to even potatoes or fried beans.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>In my home we measure ingredients based in how hungry we are but it goes something like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs per person served.</li>
      <li>3 or 4 tortillas per person served.</li>
      <li>vegetable oil</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>toppings</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice or tore apart the tortillas until they're small enough to be picked with a fork.</li>
      <li>Add oil to a pan, enough to cover the tortillas partially.</li>
      <li>Fry the tortillas in the oil and add salt to your own taste, once its fried add the eggs and your preferred topping (if it's chorizo or something that needs to be cooked, do id before adding it).</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
