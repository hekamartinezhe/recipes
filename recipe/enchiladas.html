    <p>Traditional enchiladas are prepared differenly across Mexico, 
        but here's one recipe that I found and think works best for my taste.</p>
    <p>Red enchiladas can be cooked with a variety of chiles and
        different spices in each region of Mexico. in fact,
        you can find lots of enchiladas recipes,
        like the famous ones in the state of Zacatecas, where they use
        chile ancho to make the sauce, and enchiladas from Morelia,
         Michoacán which are served with a garnish of
         potatoes and carrots seasoned with the residues of the same
         sauce when they are fried in the same oil in which the
         enchiladas are.</p> 
    <h2>How to make red enchiladas.</h2>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Guajillo chiles</li>
        <li>Chile ancho</li>
        <li>Carlic cloves</li>
        <li>Queso Fresco or Queso Cotija</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Shedeed pork or chicken</li>
        <li>White onion</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let's start with the sauce: Lightly toast the chiles on a hot griddle, pressing them down with the help of a spatula, but making sure not to burn them.
            (This step takes only a few seconds on each side). Once the chiles are roasted, place them in a saucepan with water and cook them low heat for 15 minutes,
             or until they are soft.</li>

        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the chiles cool for 10 to 15 minutes. (Remember that these should be soft and squishy).
            After the chiles have cooled, drain them and place them in the blender along with the garlic cloves; add half a cup of clean water and blend until smooth. 
            (If the sauce is too thick or the chiles were not ground well, it is necessary to pass it through a fine strainer). Season with oregano, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) to keep the enchiladas warm while you finish assembling them.</li>
        <li>In a large pan add the 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat. (Add the oil a little at a time as you fry the tortillas, 
            since adding it all at once will soak the tortillas and break them.)</li>
        <li>Dip the tortillas — one by one — into the sauce until both sides are well soaked.
            Then place the tortilla in the pan with the hot oil and fry on both sides. (This only takes a few seconds.) Place the enchilada on a plate. 
            Add more oil to the pan as needed and continue with the process of frying the tortillas: first you pass them through the sauce and then through the oil.
             Place the plate where you are putting the enchiladas in the preheated oven to keep them warm while you finish frying the rest of the tortillas.</li>
        <li> To serve the enchiladas, first place the filling of your choice in the center of the tortilla, then fold or roll it so the content stays on the inside.
            Sprinkle the enchiladas with cheese and onion; add any other garnishes to your liking, and... enjoy!</li>
