    <p>Traditional enchiladas are prepared differenly across Mexico, 
        but here's one recipe that I found and think works best for my taste.</p>
    <p>Red enchiladas can be cooked with a variety of chiles and
        different spices in each region of Mexico. in fact,
        you can find lots of enchiladas recipes,
        like the famous ones in the state of Zacatecas, where they use
        chile ancho to make the sauce, and enchiladas from Morelia,
         Michoac√°n which are served with a garnish of
         potatoes and carrots seasoned with the residues of the same
         sauce when they are fried in the same oil in which the
         enchiladas are.</p>
